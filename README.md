This repository is a mess. Hope you can dig out something useful. Good luck!

An overview of our Hair-GANs architecture. The generator and the discriminator are trained in conjunction.

## ./Ori_Conf_from_Img
This folder contains the code for orientation and confidence map generation with an image as input. Please begin from the "toRunConfidenceBuider" to track the implimentation of [Unsupervised Texture Segmentation Using Gabor
Filters](https://www.ee.columbia.edu/~sfchang/course/dip/handout/jain-texture.pdf)

## Part of the dataset
The [folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tdWl5aDORIPqf4WNTQGiaVjLYRf1f7Ug?usp=sharing) includes: strand-level hair model, strip mesh hair model, a bust model, and some code (voxelhair.zip). In voxelhair.zip, there's something about how to generate the training data. (Sorry, I can't make the code run now due to the compiling environment). As the training dataset generated from the strand-level hair + bust model, is too large to be uploaded, I upload some examples in the folder of "training_data_example" for you to take a reference.
